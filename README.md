## My process

  

### Built with

  

- Flexbox

- Mobile-first workflow

- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - The modern web  developer's platform

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

 

  

### What I learned

Also I used facade design pattern in this challenge and it is a powerful architecture for angular applications.  

I used Tailwind CSS for the first time in this challenge and yeah! I think it's fun and helpful.


  

### Continued development

  

I really want to explore more in Tailwind CSS.
